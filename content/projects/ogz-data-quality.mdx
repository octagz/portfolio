# Description

With the objective of reducing errors on data shown to final users, a series of quality checks were implemented. This incremented the confidence level on the information displayed on our procurement platform.

# Technical details
* The solution leveraged Google's Cloud Data Quality Engine, specifically tailored for BigQuery integration.
* Results from Data Quality validations were systematically stored in a dedicated BigQuery table. This table was utilized to populate dashboards, which were then programmatically accessed and monitored by data quality curators for ongoing assessment and management.
