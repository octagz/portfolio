# Project description

In this initiative, a comprehensive business intelligence application was built for materials manufacturers sold on a B2C marketplace. It integrated various technologies such as React for frontend development, Lambda functions, Athena, and DynamoDB for backend services, and Airflow for orchestrating complex data pipelines. This application played a crucial role in streamlining data management and enhancing decision-making processes.

# Main features

The application provided various types of graphs displaying information such as:
* Amount of views for each of the products sold on the marketplace
* Ranking of the most sold products
* Amount of add to carts per product
* Abandoned carts metrics
* Geospatial information about products like hot areas and lack of provisioning areas
* Sales funnel
* Hot products
* Price dispersion

# Technical details

* The login was built using Amazon Cognito solution.
* The deployment of the solution was resolved by using SAM templates, a layer on top of CloudFormation, for easier environment reproducibility both locally and on the cloud.
* Sales-related data was copied daily from production MySQL databases to a raw storage system (S3). User behavior data such as views and clicks were tracked using Matomo, an open-source alternative for Google Analytics. All this data  was then refined using SQL queries run with AWS Athena and subsequently stored in DynamoDB for faster data access and high availability.
