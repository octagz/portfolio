# Introduction

The construction industry, while being a major economic player globally, has lagged in embracing digital transformation. This slow digital adoption has resulted in inefficiencies and communication gaps among key players - constructors, distributors, and manufacturers. Traditional processes dominated the scene, and informal means like WhatsApp became the go-to for order management, leading to a lack of traceability and informed decision-making.

The introduction of Nuqlea, an innovative marketplace, aims to revolutionize this scenario by digitizing and optimizing the construction industry's processes. How does Nuqlea tackle these challenges? Letâ€™s dive in!

# The Challenge of Product Linking

Nuqlea's challenge lies in linking non-standardized product representations from various construction industry players to a unified catalog. This task involves interpreting demanded, quoted, and purchased products amidst varying nomenclature and coding systems, as highlighted in the Entity Linking section.

# Innovative Solution

### Data Collection and Cleansing

The solution begins with collecting and cleaning datasets from constructors' queries and distributors' listings. These datasets include various attributes like brand, product line, SKU, and more, which undergo rigorous cleansing processes to ensure data quality.


### The Unsupervised Modeling Approach

Nuqlea employs an unsupervised modeling approach, favoring techniques like Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF over supervised models. This choice is due to the limited size of collected data, lack of labeled information for named entity recognition models, and the need for a flexible system adaptable to daily catalog updates.
Entity Linking Model Pipeline

###  The entity linking model comprises several steps:
1. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifying brands, lines, and SKUs from queries using a similarity algorithm.
2. Search Space Filtering: Narrowing down the catalog based on identified entities.
3. Catalog Vectorization: Representing catalog products through TF-IDF-based character and word vectors.
4. Query Vectorization: Transforming queries using a soft TF-IDF approach to accommodate typos.
5. Candidate Selection: Employing cosine similarity to find the most similar catalog products.

# Experimental Insights and Results

Nuqlea's model underwent extensive testing, revealing valuable insights:

    Standardizing measures and combining character-level and word-level TF-IDF vectorizations improved product linking accuracy.
    Named entity recognition significantly increased precision by filtering the search space.

The model achieved a precision of 0.73 and a top-3 precision of 0.82 on the development dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in automating around 67% of product linkages and assisting in 82% of cases.

# Conclusion and Future Directions

Nuqlea has shown promising results in automating and assisting product linking in the construction industry, significantly reducing manual efforts. However, there's still room for improvement. Future work includes exploring pre-trained language models like BERT for enhanced named entity recognition and developing a learning system that adapts and improves over time.
